Random Array Generation: Generates random arrays of specified size.
Selection Sort Visualization: The visualizer animates the selection sort algorithm, highlighting comparisons and swaps.
Performance Metrics: Displays the number of comparisons and swaps made during the sorting process.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the website elements.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, data manipulation, and visualization of the selection sort algorithm.
Getting Started:
